## Releases

There is a loose [Road Map](./ROADMAP.md).

## Contributing

Development happens on GitHub for the spec.
Issues are used for bugs and actionable items.
We might plan to use [mailing list](#mailing-list) to discuss long term topic, but for now, we still use issues.


The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license found in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

### Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions, but please let everyone know what you are working on.

Before undertaking a nontrivial change to this community, please open an issue and start your topic.

### Mailing List

The mailing list is not provided yet. We prefer to use issue to discuss.

### Git commit

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from http://developercertificate.org):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe@gmail.com>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

You can add the sign off when creating the git commit via `git commit -s`.

#### Commit Style

Simple house-keeping for clean git history.
Read more on [How to Write a Git Commit Message][how-to-git-commit] or the Discussion section of [git-commit(1)][git-commit.1].

1. Separate the subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
  * If there was important/useful/essential conversation or information, copy or include a reference
8. When possible, one keyword to scope the change in the subject (i.e. "README: ...", "runtime: ...")
